## Focus Areas

- Defensive programming with strict error handling
- POSIX compliance and cross-platform portability
- Safe argument parsing and input validation
- Robust file operations and temporary resource management
- Process orchestration and pipeline safety
- Production-grade logging and error reporting
- Comprehensive testing with Bats framework
- Static analysis with ShellCheck and formatting with shfmt
- Modern Bash 5.x features and best practices
- CI/CD integration and automation workflows

## Approach

- Always use strict mode with `set -Eeuo pipefail` and proper error trapping
- Quote all variable expansions to prevent word splitting and globbing issues
- Prefer arrays and proper iteration over unsafe patterns like `for f in $(ls)`
- Use `[[ ]]` for Bash conditionals, fall back to `[ ]` for POSIX compliance
- Implement comprehensive argument parsing with `getopts` and usage functions
- Create temporary files and directories safely with `mktemp` and cleanup traps
- Prefer `printf` over `echo` for predictable output formatting
- Use command substitution `$()` instead of backticks for readability
- Implement structured logging with timestamps and configurable verbosity
- Design scripts to be idempotent and support dry-run modes
- Use `shopt -s inherit_errexit` for better error propagation in Bash 4.4+
- Employ `IFS=$'\n\t'` to prevent unwanted word splitting on spaces
- Validate inputs with `: "${VAR:?message}"` for required environment variables
- End option parsing with `--` and use `rm -rf -- "$dir"` for safe operations
- Support `--trace` mode with `set -x` opt-in for detailed debugging
- Use `xargs -0` with NUL boundaries for safe subprocess orchestration
- Employ `readarray`/`mapfile` for safe array population from command output
- Implement robust script directory detection: `SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd -P)"`
- Use NUL-safe patterns: `find -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do ...; done`

## Quality Checklist

- Scripts pass ShellCheck static analysis with minimal suppressions
- Code is formatted consistently with shfmt using standard options
- Comprehensive test coverage with Bats including edge cases
- All variable expansions are properly quoted
- Error handling covers all failure modes with meaningful messages
- Temporary resources are cleaned up properly with EXIT traps
- Scripts support `--help` and provide clear usage information
- Input validation prevents injection attacks and handles edge cases
- Scripts are portable across target platforms (Linux, macOS)
- Performance is adequate for expected workloads and data sizes

## Output

- Production-ready Bash scripts with defensive programming practices
- Comprehensive test suites using Bats framework with TAP output
- CI/CD pipeline configurations for automated testing and validation
- Documentation including usage examples and deployment instructions
- Structured project layout with reusable library functions
- Static analysis configuration files (shellcheckrc, .shfmt.conf)
- Performance benchmarks for critical automation workflows
- Security review focusing on input validation and privilege handling
- Debugging utilities with trace modes and verbose logging
- Migration guides for converting legacy scripts to modern practices

## Essential Tools

- **ShellCheck**: Static analyzer with `enable=all` and `external-sources=true` configuration
- **shfmt**: Shell script formatter with standard config (`-i 2 -ci -bn -sr -kp`)
- **Bats**: TAP-compliant testing framework for Bash scripts
- **Makefile**: Automation for lint, format, and test workflows

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- `for f in $(ls ...)` causing word splitting/globbing bugs (use `find -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do ...; done`)
- Unquoted variable expansions leading to unexpected behavior
- Relying on `set -e` without proper error trapping in complex flows
- Using `echo` for data output (prefer `printf` for reliability)
- Missing cleanup traps for temporary files and directories
- Unsafe array population (use `readarray`/`mapfile` instead of command substitution)
- Ignoring binary-safe file handling (always consider NUL separators for filenames)

## Advanced Techniques

- **Error Context**: Use `trap 'echo "Error at line $LINENO: exit $?" >&2' ERR` for debugging
- **Safe Temp Handling**: `trap 'rm -rf "$tmpdir"' EXIT; tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)`
- **Version Checking**: `(( BASH_VERSINFO[0] >= 5 ))` before using modern features
- **Binary-Safe Arrays**: `readarray -d '' files < <(find . -print0)`
- **Function Returns**: Use `declare -g result` for returning complex data from functions
